This assignment takes the name of an actor/actress as an input and print his/her filmography in descending order, using web scrapping method. In this program, BeautifulSoup module is used, in order to extract an information from a webpage. Here, 'actor_id.py' is used to extract the IMDB ID of the required actor/actress and 'actor.py' uses the same IMDB ID to display the filmography of the actor, extracted from his/her IMDB page in descending order. Just open the terminal and type the command - 'python actor.py'. Also, there is another program, named 'actor_app.py', which uses streamlit module to display the filmography of actors in a web page. In order to run that app, just open terminal and write the command - 'streamlit run actor_app.py'.
