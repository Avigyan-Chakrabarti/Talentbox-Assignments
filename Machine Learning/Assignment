To create an ML algorithm on the list of exoplanets discovered by Kepler and use the algorithm to clasify the planets as Candidate/False Positive/Confirmed. This ML code is created usimng jupyter notebook, and although many classification algorithms are used like KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc, still we used Random Forest, since it is the most accurate of all.
